<h3>
If - Rudyard Kipling
</h3>

<code>
If you can keep your head when all about you
<br/>
Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
<br/>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
<br/>
But make allowance for their doubting too;
<br/>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
<br/>
Or being lied about, don't deal in lies,
<br/>
Or being hated, don't give way to hating,
<br/>
And yet don't look too good, nor talk too wise:
<br/>
<br/>
If you can dream - and not make dreams your master;
<br/>
If you can think - and not make thoughts your aim;
<br/>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
<br/>
And treat those two impostors just the same;
<br/>
If you can hear the truth you've spoken
<br/>
Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
<br/>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
<br/>
And stoop and build 'em up with worn-out tools:
<br/>
<br/>
If you can make one heap of all your winnings
<br/>
And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
<br/>
And lose, and start at your beginnings
<br/>
And never breathe a word about your loss;
<br/>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
<br/>
To serve your turn long after they are gone,
<br/>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
<br/>
Except the Will which says to them: 'Hold on!'
<br/>
<br/>
If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
<br/>
Or walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,
<br/>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
<br/>
If all men count with you, but none too much;
<br/>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
<br/>
With sixty seconds' worth of distance run,
<br/>
Yours is the Earth and everything that's in it,
<br/>
And - which is more - you'll be a Man, my son!

<p>
Always stay calm and relaxed, especially when shit hits the fan. Trust 
yourself, but not too much. Don't completely dismiss what others are 
saying about you. Be patient. Never spread hate or lies. Never act 
too smart or be too pretentious.
</p>
<p>
Set up ambitious goals and actually work toward those goals. Learn to 
think, and, for certain things, learn to act without thinking. Never 
get too emotional. Ignore people that take your words out of context. 
Understand that you will break certain things in life, and be prepared 
to amend them and/or start over again. 
</p>
<p>
Take risks. Never complain, even if you made a bad call. Be resilient.
</p>
<p>
Learn to communicate with others. Stay true to your values. Strive 
for gold and status, but never spoil yourself. Don't concern yourself 
too much with the opinion of others. Be a leader. Work hard.
