	<h2>Sorting</h2>
	
	<p>April 2021</p>

	<p>
		Sorting is the problem of generating a sorted permutation of an input sequence of numbers.
		Sorting is critical because certain applications inherently need to sort information. Most
		algorithms also use sorting as key subroutines. Different sorting algorithms have different 
		performance characteristics. The default metric used to compare different algorithms is 
		running time.
	</p>

	<p>
		Insertion sort maintains a pointer that partitions the input array into two sections:
		a sorted left subarray, and an unsorted right subarray. At each iteration of the loop,
		the algorithm selects one element from the right subarray and put it into the correct 
		location in the left subarray. Insertion sort runs in O(n^2) in the worst case.
	</p> 

	<p>
		Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. The algorithm divides the input array into two 
		subarrays and recursively calls itself two times, one on each subarray. Then, the algorithm
		merges the two subarrays into one final array that is sorted. Merge sort runs in O(n*lg n)
		in the worst case.
	</p>

	<p>
		Heapsort is a sorting algorithm that uses the heap data structure. The algorithm starts
		out by building a heap on the input array. Then the algorithm executes the following loop: 
		it swaps the first (max) element of the heap with the last element of the heap, reduces 
		the size of the heap (effectively removing the max element from the heap), and calls a 
		heapify subroutine on the newly swapped element at the top of the heap to restore the 
		max-heap condition. Heapsort runs in O(n*lg n) time.
	</p>

	<p>
		Quicksort is another divide and conquer algorithm. The algorithm uses a partition 
		subroutine to partition the array into two subarrays. This subroutine returns an integer 
		<var>q</var> that satisfies the following properties: all elements to the left of
		the pivot (element at index <var>q</var>) are smaller than the pivot, and all elements o
		to the right of the pivot are larger than the pivot. The randomized version of quicksort
		runs in O(n*lg n) in the average case; the non-randomized version runs in O(n^2) in the
		worst-case.
