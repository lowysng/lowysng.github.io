	<h2>Syntactic Analysis</h2>
	
	<p>March 2021</p>

	<h3>Parser</h3>

	<p>
		The parser (or syntactic analyzer) reads a stream of words and
		determines whether the stream of words constitutes a syntactically
		valid program. It does so by building a parse tree. This parse
		tree is also used by the compiler to analyze and optimize the input
		program (see Intermediate Representations).
	</p>

	<p>
		The syntactic rules of a language are specified using a formalism
		called context-free grammars. A program is syntactically correct if
		there exists a derivation for the sequence of words that make up the
		program.
	</p>

	<p>
		Starting with a prototype string that consists of only the starting
		symbol, additional strings are derived by replacing one nonterminal
		in the prototype with the RHS of some production that has as its
		LHS the matching nonterminal.
	</p>

	<p>
		The parser finds a derivation by building a parse tree. This parse
		tree has as its root node the starting nonterminal symbol, and its
		leaves the sequence of words that make up the program. The goal of
		the parser is to build the part of the tree between the root and the
		leaves.
	</p>

	<h3>Top-Down and Bottom-Up Parsing</h3>

	<p>
		A parser can build the parse tree from top to bottom, or from the
		bottom to the top. A top-down parser expands nodes, starting at the
		root node; a bottom-up parser reduces nodes, starting from the leaves.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		At each step of the parse, the parser has to select the correct
		production to use to expand or reduce the nodes with. In top-down
		parsing, we apply the backtrack-free constraint to the CFGs to
		enforce this behavior. With a backtrack-free grammar, the parser will
		always pick the correct production for expansion (if it exists), using
		a one symbol lookahead.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are two strategies for implementing top-down parsers. Recursive
		descent top-down parsers use procedures (one for each nonterminal)
		that call each other recursively, advancing the input stream whenever
		they recognize the appropriate symbols. A table-driven LL(1) parser
		uses a generated parsing table to drive a skeleton parser.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		An alternative to top-down parsing is bottom-up parsing. A bottom-up
		parser has to find a valid substring in the input stream and find
		a production with the matching RHS, before it can reduce the substring
		into the LHS of that production.
	</p>

	<p>
		An LR(1) parser is an implementation of a table-driven bottom-up parser.
		The grammars used by LR(1) parsers do not need to be constrained. Instead,
		the parser stack, which encodes the upper frontier of the partially build tree,
		is interleaved with additional state information that stores some local
		left-hand context about the parsing history thus far. The skeleton
		parser uses the stack and a set of parsing tables to determine what to
		do next --- either to reduce a substring in the frontier or to push more
		symbols onto the stack to gain more context.
