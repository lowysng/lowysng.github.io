	<h2>Binary Search Trees</h2>
	
	<p>April 2021</p>

	<p>
		A binary search tree (BST) is an implementation of a dynamic set (set with changing
		elements). Each node <var>x</var> in the tree satisfies the following property: 
		each node in the left subtree of <var>x</var> has a key value less
		than or equal to that of <var>x</var>; each node in the right subtree of
		<var>x</var> has a key value greater than or equal to that of <var>x</var>.
	</p>

	<p>
		All binary search tree operations take O(h) time to run in the worst case, where
		<var>h</var> is the height of the tree.
	</p>

	<p>
		To search for a particular node <var>p</var> in a BST, start by checking whether 
		the current node <var>x</var> (initialized to the root node) matches <var>p</var>.
		If not, check whether <var>p.key &lt; x.key</var>. If this is
		true, recursively search the left child of <var>x</var>. Otherwise, recursively
		search the right child <var>x</var>.
	</p>

	<p>
		To find the minimum node, starting at the root node, repeatedly traverse down the
		left subtree until a leaf is encountered. This leaf is the minimum node. To find 
		the maximum, repeatedly traverse down the right subtree.
	</p>

	<p>
		To find the successor (next larger node) of a node <var>x</var>, start be checking
		whether <var>x</var> has a right subtree. If so, then the successor is just the
		minimum node in the right subtree of <var>x</var>. Otherwise, the successor is
		the lowest ancestor of <var>x</var> whose left child is also an ancestor of <var>x</var>.
		The proceedure for finding the predecessor is symmetrical.
	</p>

	<p>
		To insert a node <var>z</var> into a BST, starting at the root node, traverse down 
		the tree in the following manner: go down the left subtree of <var>x</var> if 
		<var>z.key &lt; x.key</var>, otherwise go down the right subtree. Repeat until
		a leaf node is encountered, and set <var>z</var> as the appropriate children of
		this leaf node.
	</p>

	<p>
		To delete a node <var>z</var> from a BST is slightly more intricate. The computation
		is organized into three cases. If <var>z</var> has no left child, then replace
		<var>z</var> with its right child (which may or may not be a node). Else if
		<var>z</var> has only one (left) child, then replace <var>z</var> with its
		left child. If none of these are true, then find the predecessor of <var>z</var> 
		and call it <var>y</var>.
