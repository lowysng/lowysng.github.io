	<h2>Machine-Level Procedures</h2>

	<p>February 2021</p>
	
	<p>
		Procedures are a key abstraction in software. They package code into pieces that 
		can be reused throughout a program. Procedures help manage program complexity 
		by abstracting away the details of how they are implemented from the programmer.
	</p>

	<p>
		Certain attributes about procedures need to be satisfied when implementing them at 
		the machine level. These include some mechanism for passing control, some mechanism for passing data,
		and some mechanism for allocating and deallocating memory.
	</p>	

	<h3>Program Stack</h3>

	<p>
		The procedure-calling mechanisms of most languages make use of the stack data structure.
		Any running procedure has a private space on the stack called the stack frame. The stack frame 
		of a procedure contains all local variables, the values of all callee-saved registers, and an 
		argument buildup area for other procedures that it might call. Conventionally, the stack grows 
		toward lower addresses in memory. 
	</p>

	<h3>Passing Control</h3>

	<p>
		Passing control simply involves pushing the return address onto the stack, and then jumping to the 
		address of the first instruction in the procedure. The return address is 
		the address of instruction immediately following the jump instruction (not the target instruction).
		Whenever a procedure has finished executing, it returns by popping the stack and jumping to the instruction 
		at the memory location specified by the popped value. 
	</p>

	<h3>Passing Data</h3>

	<p>
		Passing data is a bit more intricate. When a procedure calls another procedure, one of two things might happen, 
		depending on the number of arguments of the called procedure. When the number of arguments is lower than some 
		threshold (for x86-64 this number is 6), all arguments are passed via the registers. In this case, the called 
		procedure may access the arguments by accessing the registers directly. In the exceptional case, when the number 
		of arguments passes the threshold, all additional arguments re passed via the calling procedure's stack frame, in 
		the argument buildup area. 
	</p>

	<h3>Local Storage</h3>

	<p>
		Procedures have local variables. In most cases, these variables are stored on the register. However, there 
		are cases where the local variables have to be stored in memory. This can happen when there are not enough registers 
		to hold all local data, the address operator is applied, or some of the variables are arrays or structures. 
		In this case, the local variables are stored in the procedure's stack frame.
	</p>

	<p>
		Also, a subset of the registers in a processor are classified as callee-saved registers. It is assumed 
		that all called procedures will restore the value of these registers before they return. This means that 
		a calling procedure can safely store data in these registers without having to worry that the called procedure 
		might alter it. 
	</p>

	<h3>Recursive Procedures and Stack Overflow</h3>
	
	<p>
		These conventions allow procedures to call themselves recursively, since each procedure will have its own 
		private space on the stack. One way things can go wrong is when a recursive procedure goes into an infinite 
		loop (perhaps it is poorly defined). The stack grows indefinitely until there isn't any more space in memory 
		available for allocation for any additional procedures --- a stack overflow.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Buffer Overflow Attacks</h3>

	<p>
		Another way things can go wrong is called buffer overflow. C does not perform bound checking for array 
		references. This means that the stack can be corrupted by an out-of-bounds write to an array. Buffer overflow 
		can be exploited by attackers, causing the system to execute unauthorized code. This is done by injecting 
		the byte encoding of the exploit code onto the stack, and then modifying the return address to point to this 
		exploit code.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are several mechanisms for defending against buffer overflow attacks. Three of the most common mechanisms 
		are stack randomization, stack protection, and limitting the region in memory that can hold executable code.
