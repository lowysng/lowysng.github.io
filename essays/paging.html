	<h2>Paging</h2>
	
	<p>February 2021</p>

	<p>
		The core idea of paging is to divide physical memory into equally-sized chunks called page frames.
		Similarly, the virtual address space of a process is divided into equally-sized virtual pages. Each 
		virtual page maps to a physical page frame.
	</p>

	<h3>Page Table</h3>
	
	<p>
		This mapping information is stored in a per-process data structure called a page table. The simplest 
		page table is simply an array (also a linear page table). This array is indexed by the virtual page 
		number of a process. The entries of this array are called the page table entries (PTEs).
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Each PTE contains a number of useful information. Most importantly, it contains the physical frame 
		number for this virtual page. Additionally, the PTE also contains a valid bit that indicates whether 
		a translation is valid, protection bits for specifying read, write and execute permissions, a present 
		bit for page swapping (see <a href="#" >Swapping</a>), a reference bit for caching, a dirty bit, and 
		so on.
	</p>

	<p>
		Linear paging on its own is very slow. For every memory reference, linear paging requires us to perform 
		one extra memory reference into the linear page table. To speed things up, a hardware cache called a 
		translation-lookaside buffer (TLB) is installed in the memory management unit of the CPU. This TLB operates 
		like most typical caches, it exploits temporal locality and spatial locality by storing the most recently 
		performed address translations. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Another issue with linear paging is that the page tables themselves can use up significant amounts of 
		memory. A very straightforward solution is to use larger page sizes (less entries per table of the same size). 
		This solution is less than ideal because large page sizes tend to be wasteful due to internal fragmentation. 
	</p>

	<p>
		An alternative solution is to use a hybrid of paging and segmentations. Instead of using one page 
		table per process, we use multiple page tables, one per logical segment of the process. This solution 
		is also not ideal because segmentation leads to external fragmentation, making it hard for the OS to 
		allocate memory for additional segments.
	</p>

	<h3>Multi-Level Page Tables</h3>

	<p>
		A alternative to linear paging is to use multi-level page tables.
		In multi-level paging, each page table is itself divided into equally-sized chunks. Each page table chunk 
		becomes an entry in a new data structure called a page directory. If all the PTEs in a page table chunk 
		are invalid, then we can mark the corresponding page directory entry as invalid and not allocate any 
		physical memory for that chunk of the page table.
	</p>

	<p>
		The advantages of multi-level paging are straightforward. The size of each page table is now proportional 
		to the amount of page table entries that are valid in that table. The resulting page tables are more efficient 
		and less wasteful. Also, if the page table chunks themselves are of the same size as the physical page frames,
		then it becomes very easy for the OS to allocate memory for additional page table chunks.
	</p>

	<p>
		However, one downside of multi-level paging is that TLB misses are now more expensive. Assuming a 2-level page table, each TLB 
		misses now requires two memory references, one to index the page directory, another to index the page table 
		chunk pointed by the page directory. 
	</p>

	<h3>Inverted Page Tables</h3>

	<p>
		Instead of maintaining multiple page tables, one for each running process in the system, the OS can use one single table 
		that has an entry for each physical page frame of the system. This table is called an inverted page table. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Each entry in an inverted page table indicates the process that is using this page, along with the virtual 
		page number of that process that maps to this particular physical page. In this approach, address translation 
		is performed simply by searching through this single table.
