	<h2>Finite State Machines</h2>

	<p>February 2021</p>	

	<p>
		The finite state machine is a very simple model of computation.
		They are good models for computers with very limited amount of 
		memory, such as an automatic door controller. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Very simply, a finite state machine is a machine that has state. 
		This machine is capable of "reading" symbols. The machine transitions 
		from one state to another state, depending on what 
		the current state is and what symbol was read. 
	</p>

	<p>
		By feeding the machine a sequence of symbols (also called a string),
		we can induce the machine into going through a series of states. This 
		process of reading symbols and transitioning between states repeats
		itself until the machine has read every symbol in the string.
		This is the essence of what a computation is --- reading symbols 
		and transitioning between states.
	</p>

	<p>
		We can go a bit further and label some of the machine states as accept 
		states. After reading the final symbol in a string, if the machine is 
		in an accept state, we say that the machine accepts the string. 
	</p>

	<p>		
		What we have done here is implicitly partition the set of all possible 
		strings into two sets: the set of strings that are accepted by our 
		machine, and those that are not accepted by our machine. We call the 
		former set the language of the machine.	
	</p>
	
	<h3>Regular Languages</h3>

	<p>
		Some strings are accepted by some finite state machine, but most 
		strings aren't. There are some strings that no finite state machine 
		can accept. Collect these strings together, put them in a set, and 
		you get a non-regular language. In contrast, a regular language 
		is a set of strings that are accepted by some finite state machine. 
	</p>

	<p>
		A minor digression. A language (regular or nonregular) is 
		a set of strings. There are three interesting operations that we can 
		perform on languages. We call these the regular operations (we explain 
		why they are called regular in a minute): 
	</p>

	<ul class="no-line-height">
		<li>union: aggregate strings from both languages into one big language</li>
		<li>concatenate: create a new language that consists of strings that 
		are concatenation of strings from the first language and strings from 
		the second language</li>
		<li>A*: create a new language that consists of strings from the original 
		language concatenated 0 or more times.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Here is the kicker. The set of regular languages is closed under these 
		three operations. This means that, when you take any languages that are 
		regular, and you apply any one of these operations on these languages, 
		you get another language that is itself regular! This is not at all 
		obvious because intuition might suggest (at least for concatenate and A*) 
		that these operations could yield nonregular languages, since the 
		language space has been heavily altered.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since a language is a set of strings, it is natural to use set notation 
		to describe a language. This is not the only way. We can also 
		use the regular operations to describe languages. For instance, both of the 
		following expressions describe the same language (assuming alphabet = {0, 1}):
	</p>
	
	<ol class="no-line-height">
		<li>L = {w | w ends with a 1}</li>
		<li>L = (0 U 1)*1</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The second expression is called a regular expression. In this regular expression, 
		all three regular operations were used in describing L (the concatenate 
		operation is written implicitly).
	</p>

	<p>
		Here is another kicker, this time on regular expressions. The set of 
		languages that can be described by a regular expression is exactly the 
		set of languages that are regular! In other words, whatever regular expression 
		you can come up with, no matter how hairy it is, it is possible to 
		create a finite state machine that recognizes the language described 
		by your regular expression. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Conversely, if you design a finite state machine that has 2^100 states, 
		it is possible to write a (very convoluted) regular expression that describes 
		the language recognized by your giant machine.
	</p>

	<h3>Nondeterminism and Nonregular Languages</h3>

	<p>
		Recall that a finite state machine transitions from one state to another state 
		everytime it reads a symbol. One variant of the finite state machine, called a 
		nondeterministic finite state machine (NFA), operates in a slightly different manner. 
		Instead of being in exactly one state at any given moment, an NFA is capable of 
		being in multiple states at a given time.
	</p>

	<p>
		For every finite state machine, it is possible to design an equivalent 
		NFA that computes the same thing as the finite state machine (and vice versa). 
		In most cases, the nondeterministic version of a machine is preferred over 
		the deterministic version because it has a more concise and simpler representation.
	</p>

	<p>
		Recall again that a regular language is a language that is recognized by some 
		finite state machine. To show that a given language is regular, you can either 
		specify a regular expression that describes the language or build a finite state 
		machine that recognizes the language. 
	</p>

	<p>
		To show that a language is nonregular, however, is slightly trickier. We will 
		need to use the pumping lemma, which states that any regular language has a 
		pumping length where for any string s in the language that has length at least 
		the pumping length, s can be pumped. By "pumped" we mean that there is a substring in s that 
		can be repeated multiple times, and in all cases the resulting string is in 
		the language.
	</p>

	<p>
		The standard method for proving that a language is nonregular is to use proof by 
		contradiction. Suppose that the language is regular, and show that there is a string 
		that is at least the length of the pumping length that cannot be pumped. This is a 
		contradiction, therefore it must be the case that the language is nonregular.
	</p>
