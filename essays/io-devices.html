	<h2>I/O Devices</h2>
	
	<p>March 2021</p>
	
	<p>
		An I/O device generates input and/or accepts output from a computer system.
		Common examples of I/O devices are keyboards, mouse, storage disks etc.
		On modern hardware systems, I/O devices are typically connected to the I/O 
		chip of the system via different types of connections, depending on the 
		devices. For instance, most storage disk drives are connected over eSATA;
		peripheral devices such as the keyboard and mouse are connected over USB. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Abstractly, a device has an interface and a set of internals. The OS interacts
		with the device via its interface. The internals of the device implement the 
		abstraction provided by the device to the system. Every device's interface 
		is composed of three types of registers: a status register, one or more 
		command registers, and one or more data registers.
	</p>

	<h3>Interacting with the OS</h3>

	<p>
		There are two paradigms for how the OS interacts with the I/O devices connected 
		to it. The first is via explicit I/O instructions. The OS executes these 
		I/O instructions to pass data and commands in to the device registers. The 
		second paradigm is called memory-mapped I/O. In this approach, the OS 
		interacts with the device registers as if they were located in memory. Whenever 
		a read or write operation is executed, the hardware routes these operations to 
		the device instead of main memory. Both approaches are still in use today.
	</p>

	<p>
		What does a typical interaction between the OS and an I/O device look like?
		First, the OS has to read the status register of the device to check whether 
		the device is currently busy. If this is true, then the OS has to wait. It can 
		either read the status register indefinitely until the device becomes ready (called 
		polling), or it can use an interrupt-based approach --- move on to other tasks 
		and let the device issue an interrupt when it becomes ready.
	</p>

	<p>
		When the device becomes ready, the OS starts to process the I/O request by 
		writing the appropriate values into the data and command registers of the device. 
		The OS moves data either directly or indirectly in to the data registers. In the 
		direct approach, the OS is responsible for copying data from physical memory 
		into the device registers. This approach is called programmed I/O (PIO).
	</p>

	<p>
		A more efficient indirect approach (called DMA) is to use 
		dedicated hardware to move data from physical memory into the device registers, 
		freeing up the processor for other jobs in the job queue.
	</p>

	<p>
		After both the data and command registers have been succesfully written into,
		the I/O device transitions into the busy state and starts processing the 
		data in these registers. Similar to earlier, the OS can either spin wait for 
		the I/O operation to complete or it can move on to other tasks and listen 
		for an interrupt from the device.
	</p>

	<h3>Device Drivers</h2>
	
	<p>
		Another crucial component of an I/O device is its driver software. The device 
		driver is a piece of software that implements an OS-defined interface. Every 
		type of device has its own driver software which must be installed on to the system 
		before the device can be used. This is necessary to support the range of different 
		hardware devices that serve the same purpose. As an example, both a USB keychain drive 
		and a flash-based SSD need to have their own device driver so that they become 
		compatible wtih the file system of the OS.
