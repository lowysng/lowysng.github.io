	<h2>Virtual Address Space</h2>
	
	<p>February 2021</p>

	<p>
		Virtualizing memory is one of the key job of an operating system.
		Memory virtualization is motivated by the increase in popularity of 
		time sharing in early computer systems.
	</p>

	<p>
		One important concept in memory virtualization is the address space.
		Each running program has its own private space 
		in memory that contains information relevant to that program (code, stack, heap).
		The OS and hardware enforces protection and isolation between the processes by 
		making sure that each process has access only to its own address space.	
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Another consequence of the address space abstraction is that there are now 
		two kinds of memory addresses: virtual addresses and physical addresses. 
		Virtual addresses exist only within the context of a program's address space.
		When a program makes a reference to memory, it does so via a virtual address.
		It is up to the OS and the hardware to translate this into an actual physical
		address in memory. 
	</p>

	<h3>Base and Bounds</h3>

	<p>
		The most basic approach to implementing address translation is to use a pair of 
		registers called the base register and the bounds register --- both reside 
		in the memory management unit of the processor. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The base register is used to compute the physical address of a given virtual 
		address --- by adding the base to the virtual address. 
	</p>

	<p>
		When a process is created, the OS decides where in memory it should store the 
		address space of this process. The OS then proceeds to store this information in 
		the base register, which becomes a part of the register context of the program.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that this scheme allows the OS to change the location of the address space 
		of a running program (which has to be descheduled first) by changing the value stored in 
		the base register. Writing to the base (and the bounds) registers are privileged 
		operations --- they can only be performed by the OS. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The bounds register is there to prevent out-of-bounds references. An out-of-bounds reference is 
		when a program tries to access memory outside its address space. When this happens, 
		an exception is raised, which passes control back to the OS.
	</p>

	<p>
		Base and bounds is simple, but it is non-optimal. In most cases, the stack and heap of a 
		program do not grow too large. This results in a lot of wasted space between the two. We 
		call this type of waste an internal fragmentation.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Segmentation</h3>
	
	<p>
		The solution to internal fragmentation is segmentation. Segmentation is a generalization 
		of base and bounds. Multiple pairs of base and bounds registers are used, one for each 
		logical segment (code, stack and heap). Each segment can now be put independently in memory. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Now that there are multiple base and bounds register pairs, the hardware needs 
		some scheme of determining which type of segment an address is referring to. 
		The conventional approach is partition the bits of the address into two groups, one 
		for specifying the segment, the other for computing the physical address space.
		Additionally, one bit is reserved for specifying which way the segment grows (stack and 
		heap grows in opposite direction). These conventions ensure that the hardware is capable of 
		computing the physical addresses correctly.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		We can increase efficiency by allowing memory segments to be shared between 
		different address spaces (code sharing is common today). This is implemented 
		by incorporating a set of protection bits (read, write, execute) into the hardware system. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Segmentation raises one very critical issue, namely the problem of external fragmentation.
		External fragmentation happens when you have many small pockets of free space that sit between 
		segments. These little pockets make it very difficult to allocate new segments for new processes, 
		or grow existing ones. 
	</p>

	<p>
		One solution is to compact memory periodically by rearranging the existing segments into 
		one contiguous chunk. This method is less than ideal because copying segments is a very 
		expensive operation. An alternative solution is to use space management algorithms to allocate 
		and free memory in a manner that minimizes external fragmentation.
