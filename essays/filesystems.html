	<h2>File Systems</h2>
	
	<p>March 2021</p>

	<p>
		The file system is an OS level software. It's goal is to 
		store data persistently, allowing for long term storage and 
		retrieval. 
	</p>

	<p>
		A file system partitions disk into different types of blocks. 
		The two main types are the data blocks which store the actual 
		contents of the file, and the inode blocks which store file 
		metadata. The file system also maintains some allocation 
		structures for these two block types called the bitmaps. 
		Furthermore, there is a superblock that contains file system
		metadata.
	</p>

	<p>
		The most important structure in a file system is the inode. 
		Each file in the system has an inode that tracks metadata about 
		that file, including last accessed time, file size, file type, 
		and most critically, the set of pointers to the actual contents 
		of the file (some systems use multi-level indirect pointers to 
		accommodate large files). Note that a directory is just a 
		special type of file that has as its contents a list of 
		(filename, inode number) pairs.
	</p>

	<h3>Basic File System</h3>

	<p>
		Consider the file system described above. Suppose that the client
		wants to open and read the file <code>/foo/bar</code>. The access 
		path for this operation is as follows:
	</p>

	<ol class="no-line-height">
		<li>Get root inode number (well-known by the file system)</li>
		<li>Locate inode block containing the root inode</li>
		<li>Look inside the root inode to find the pointers to the contents 
		of the root dir</li>
		<li>Look for a <code>foo</code> entry inside the root dir</li>
		<li>Get <code>foo</code> inode number</li>
		<li>Locate inode block containing the <code>foo</code> inode</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ol>	

	<p>
		The ellipsis (...) means that the process repeats itself --- pathname 
		traversal is a recursive process. The process continues until 
		the inode of the target file has been found, in which case the inode 
		is moved into memory. This inode also gets updated (to reflect the 
		new last accessed time).
	</p>

	<p>
		Notice the potentially large amount of I/O operations that are 
		involved in this sequence of activities. To combat this, file 
		systems typically cache recently fetched blocks in memory.
	</p>

	<p>
		This basic file system is simple, and it is operationally correct. However,
		it has very poor performance. It views disk as one giant array of blocks.
		Data blocks and inode blocks are scattered everywhere, with no regards to 
		their locality (inodes and their data are typically accessed together.)
	</p>

	<h3>Fast File System</h3>
	
	<p>
		The Fast File System (FFS) exploits locality to improve performance by
		placing inodes and their data in close proximity. FFS adds one extra
		layer of indirection called block groups, which are just group of 
		blocks. Each block group has its own data blocks, inode blocks, 
		bitmaps, and superblock. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Blocks (within the same group) that are logically close to each other 
		are also physically close to each other, this means that the amount 
		of overheads incurred by the hardware can be reduced. In disk terms, 
		this means that the seek time for I/O requests are reduced.
	</p>
	<p>
		FFS has its own policies for allocating files and directories. In 
		allocating directories, FFS makes sure to spread them evenly among 
		block groups, by finding the block groups with low number of directories 
		and high amount of free inodes. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As for files, FFS always allocates them in the same block group as their 
		parent directory. Furthermore, FFS ensures that both the inode 
		blocks and the data blocks of each file are allocated to the same 
		group. An exception is made for large files. The data blocks of 
		a large file are spread evenly among block groups to prevent them 
		from consuming all the data blocks within one block group.
	</p>

	<h3>Crash-Consistency Problem</h3>

	<p>
		Recall that the goal of the file system is to store data persistently.
		This issue becomes tricky when we take into account the possibility of 
		the computer shutting down unexpectedly. This can lead to problems 
		like file system inconsistencies and corrupted data.
	</p>

	<p>
		The go-to method today for addressing this issue is called journaling.
		The core idea behind journaling is to write down all pending updates 
		in a separate log, before actually performing them. Here is a summary 
		of the steps in journaling:
	</p>


	<ol class="no-line-height">
		<li>Data write: write data blocks into disk</li>
		<li>Journal write: write transaction begin block and metadata updates in journal</li>
		<li>Journal commit: write transaction commit block</li>
		<li>Checkpoint: perform on-disk metadata updates</li>
		<li>Free: mark transaction as free (release memory)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		If a crash occurs during or before (3.), then that transaction and its data are lost.
		If a crash occurs after (3.), then the file system can initiate a recovery process
		and replay all committed transactions. As mentioned, journaling does not solve 
		the problem of lost data, but it does prevent any inconsistencies and garbage data 
		from appearing in the file system. Also, to reduce the number of transactions in the 
		journal, multiple transactions are usually batched and aggregated into a single 
		global transaction.
	</p>

	<h3 id="log-structured">Log-Structured File System</h3>

	<p>
		A log-structured file system (LFS) is a high performance file system that takes advantage 
		of the sequential bandwidth of disks. LFS buffers all updates in an in-memory segment,
		and writes out this segment into disk only when the segment becomes full. Furthermore, 
		segments are always written into an unused part of the disk. In other words, when a file is updated,
		LFS does not overwrite the file in disk. Instead, LFS writes out a new version of that 
		file in some free location within the disk --- the old version becomes obsolete.
	</p>

	<p>
		How do you find the correct inode of a file, given that there are now multiple versions 
		of that inode, all scattered throughout disk? The solution is to use a data structure 
		called an inode map (imap). The imap takes an inode number and returns the address of the 
		most recent version of that inode. 
	</p>

	<p>	
		The imap is updated in the same way as the inodes --- by writing the most recent 
		version of the imap in the segment. Also, to improve performance, the imap is 
		broken into chunks, and is updated on a per-chunk basis. The addresses of the most
		recent imap chunks are stored in a fixed place in disk called the checkpoint region. This 
		checkpoint region is updated periodically. 
	</p>

	<p>
		One critical component of LFS is the garbage collector. The garbage collector finds 
		all old versions of file structures (garbage) that are on disk, and clean them up so 
		that the blocks become free again for subsequent writes. Garbage collection also 
		operates on a per-segment basis. When cleaning up a segment, the garbage collector 
		determines the blocks in that segments that are live and those that are garbage. 
		These live blocks are rewritten into disk (via a new segment), and the entire old 
		segment becomes freed up.
	</p>

	<p>
		All pending segment writes are logged in the checkpoint region (CR) of the file system.
		LFS maintains two versions of the CR, and updates them alternately. When a 
		system crash occurs during a CR write, the file system can initiate the recovery process 
		using the other CR. When a system crash occurs during a segment write, the LFS can 
		easily recover by reading into the CR. Note that the CR is updated periodically, meaning 
		that it is possible for the last few seconds of updates to be lost (those that are not 
		logged into the CR).
