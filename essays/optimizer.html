	<h2>Optimizer</h2>

	<p>April 2021</p>
	
	<p>
		The goal of the optimizer is to improve the quality of the code generated
		by the backend. In optimizing a program, the compiler must ensure that
		the meaning of the program is preserved and also that the transformed
		program is an improvement over the original program.
	</p>

	<p>
		The compiler optimizes a program mainly by reducing the overhead of
		various source-level abstractions and by taking advantage of special cases. 
		The optimizer also
		uses information about the target machine, such as its ISA and number of 
		functional units, to improve the runtime performance of the program on
		that machine.
	</p>

	<p>
		Optimizations operate at different granularities, or scopes:  
	</p>

	<ul class="no-line-height">
		<li>Local methods operate over single blocks.</li>
		<li>Regional methods operate over regions larger than a single block
		but smaller than a procedure.</li>
		<li>Global methods operate over a procedure.</li>
		<li>Whole-program methods operate over multiple procedures.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Local Optimization</h3>

	<p>
		Local value numbering finds redundant expressions in a basic block and
		replaces the redundant evaluations with reuse of a previously computed
		value. In general, local value number is profitable. However, replacing
		code can extend or shorten the lifetimes of variables. This increases
		or decreases the demands for registers, which may or may not cause register
		spillage.
	</p>

	<p>
		Tree-height balancing reorganizes heavily left- or right-leaned expression
		trees into one that is more balanced. This exposes additional parallelism
		in expression evaluation --- the nodes of the resulting tree has less
		dependencies between them.
	</p>

	<h3>Regional Optimization</h3>

	<p>
		Superlocal value numbering is an extension of local value numbering to larger
		regions called extended basic blocks. Roughly speaking, an extended basic
		block is a region of code that is larger than a single basic block but 
		smaller than a procedure.
	</p>

	<p>
		Loop unrolling reduces the amount of loop overheads by increasing the size
		of the loop body to reduce the total number of loop iterations required
		to compute the same result. For instance, a loop computation that does 1
		thing n times can be unrolled into one that does 2 things n/2 times.
	</p>

	<h3>Global Optimization</h3>

	<p>
		Global code placement exploits asymmetric branch costs to reduce branching
		overheads. Consider a piece of code with a branching point that splits into
		two branches. The optimizer can perform a profile run to determine which one
		of the two branches executes more frequently. Then, it can reorganize the
		linear sequence of code such that the branch that is executed more
		frequently becomes the fall-through branch of the branch point.
	</p>

	<h3>Whole-Program Optimization</h3>

	<p>
		Inline substitution eliminates the overheads of invoking a procedure by
		replacing its call site with a copy of the procedure's body. Inlining
		can improve runtime performance, but it can also degrade performance.
		Replacing a call site with the body of the called procedure can increase
		code size and the name space size, which may increase register demands.
	</p>

	<p>
		Procedures within a single executable image can also be rearranged to increase
		the performance of the program. Using a call graph, the optimizer can
		rearrange the procedures to reduce virtual-memory working-set sizes and to limit
		the potential for call-induced conflicts in the instruction cache. In
		other words, if a procedure calls another proecdure, the ideal case
		would be to have both procedures occupy adjacent locations in memory.
	</p>
