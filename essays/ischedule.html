	<h2>Instruction Scheduling</h2>
	
	<p>April 2021</p>

	<p>
		The execution time of a sequence of operations depends heavily
		on the order of the set of operations. Instruction scheduling is
		the process of reodering the operations to improve running time.
		Instruction scheduling is hard because:
	</p>
	
	<ul class="no-line-height">
		<li>There are dependencies between the operations; one cannot be 
		issued before its operands are ready.</li>
		<li>Different operations have different latencies.</li>
		<li>Most processors are superscalar processors with different
		functional units that can execute multiple operations concurrently.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>
		The instruction scheduling problem is defined over the dependence
		graph D of a basic block. The edges in D represent flow of values.
		The nodes in D, which corresponds to operations, have two attributes: 
		optype, which specifies the functional unit, and delay, which specifies 
		the number of cycles required for completion.
	</p>

	<p>
		Given a dependence graph, a schedule S maps each node in D to a nonnegative
		integer that denotes the cycle in which it should be issued, assuming that
		the first operation issues in cycle 1. The i-th operation is just the
		set of operations that issue in cycle i.
	</p>

	<p>
		A schedule must meet three constraints:
	</p>

	<ol class="no-line-height">
		<li>No operation can be issued before execution starts.</li>
		<li>An operation cannot issue until its operands have been defined.</li>
		<li>Each instruction contains no more operations of each type t than the 
		target machine can issue in a cycle.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		An operation x is antidependent on y if x precedes y and y defines a value
		used in x. Antidependences are resolved either by respecting them in the
		final schedule (through further reordering) or renaming the values (which
		may increase register demands and cause spillage).
	</p>

	<p>
		Instruction scheduling is NP-complete. In practice, approximate solutions
		to scheduling problems are generated using greedy heuristics. Most scheduling 
		algorithms are based on one family of heuristic techniques called list 
		scheduling.
	</p>

	<h3>List Scheduling</h3>

	<p>
		List scheduling is a greedy, heuristic approach to scheduling the operations
		in a basic block (can be extended into multi-block sequences).
		The basic outline of the algorithm is:
	</p>

	<ol class="no-line-height">
		<li>Rename values to avoid antidependences.</li>
		<li>Build a dependence graph.</li>
		<li>Assign priorities to each operation.</li>
		<li>Iteratively select operation and schedule it.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The algorithm uses a cycle counter and two lists to track operations. 
		The <code>Ready</code> 
		list holds all the operations that can execute in the current cycle. The 
		<code>Active</code> list contains operations that were issued earlier but 
		have not yet finished. At each step, the algorithm accounts for any 
		operations completed in the previous cycle by examining <code>Active</code>,
		then it schedules one operation in <code>Ready</code> for the current cycle,
		and increments the cycle counter.
	</p>

	<p>
		The quality of the schedule produced depends primarily on the mechanism
		used to pick an operation from <code>Ready</code>. Various priority ranks may
		be used, none dominates the others in terms of the overall schedule quality:
	</p>

	<ol class="no-line-height">
		<li>latency-weighted path length: operations that are on the critical path are scheduled first</li>
		<li>total number of descendants: operations that compute critical values for many other nodes are scheduled first</li>
		<li>delay: long-latency operations are scheduled first</li>
		<li>number of last use operands: move last use values closer to their definitions, reducing demand for registers.</li>
	</ol>
