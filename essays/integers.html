    <h2>Bits as Integers</h2>

    <p>February 2021</p>

    <p>
        A string of bits (ones and zeros) can be interpreted as representing an integer. The set of integers 
        that can be represented depends on the number of bits used. Quite simply, the more bits you have, the more 
        integers you can represent. 
    </p>

    <h3>Unsigned and 2's Complement Encodings</h3>

    <p>
        The two most common encoding schemes are unsigned encoding and two's complement 
        encoding.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unsigned encoding is used to represent nonnegative integers. The number represented by a bit vector is a 
        weighted sum of a collection of powers of two. For instance, 1101 represents 13 because 13 = 1*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1.
        With one bit you can represent two integers, namely 0 and 1. With two bits you can represent four integers: 0, 1, 2, 3.
        In general, with n bits, you can represent the integers from 0 up to 2^n - 1, inclusive.
    </p>

    <p>
        Two's complement encoding lets you represent negative values (with unsigned encoding you can only represent the nonnegative 
        integers). The number represented is also a weighted sum of powers of two, except that the most significant bit is weighted 
        negatively. With n bits, you can represent the integers from -2^(n-1) to 2^(n-1) - 1, inclusive.
    </p>

    <h3>Interesting Numbers</h3>

    <p>
        A string of all ones, interpreted as an unsigned number, is the maximum integer that can be represented in the range. 
        That same string interpreted as a signed number always represents the integer -1. For instance, 1111 represents 15 and -1 
        respectively. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In two's complement encoding, a string of bits consisting of a 1 followed by all 0's represents the smallest integer in the 
        range. On the other hand, a string of bits consisting of a 0 followed by all 1's represents the largest integer in the range. 
        For instance, 1000 represents -8 whereas 0111 represents 7.
    </p>

    <h3>Addition and Overflows</h3>

    <p>
        When a computer tries to add two strings of bits together, something peculiar might happen.
        Suppose that you have two 4-bit strings, and suppose that you take the sum of the two unsigned integer represented by these 
        bit strings. One of two cases might happen. In the normal case, the result of the operation is within the range of integers 
        representable by a 4-bit string. For instance, 1100 + 0011 = 1111 which is equivalent to 12 + 3 = 15, and 3, 12, 15 can all 
        be represented using 4 bits. 
    </p>

    <p>
        In the exceptional case, the result of the sum cannot be represented by a 4-bit string. This is called an overflow. 
        As an example, 12 + 4 = 16, but 16 
        cannot be represented using 4 bits. We need 5 bits to represent 16 (10000). This is bad. It's bad because we don't want 
        to add two 4-bit strings and get a 5-bit string back; we want the result to be 4-bit as well. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The straightforward solution to overflow is to drop the leading bit of the 5-bit result, yielding a 4-bit string. This is exactly 
        how computer addition is implemented. Whenever the addition of two n-bit strings yields a n+1-bit string, the leading bit is 
        dropped. Mathematically, this is equivalent to applying the modulus 2^n operation. For instance, 12 + 4 = 16 mod 16 = 0, which 
        checks out with 1100 + 0100 = 0000.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overflow can also happen when you add two signed integers. A negative overflow happens when the addition of two negative numbers 
        yields a negative number that is less than the minimum integer representable. A positive overflow is defined similarly. Both are 
        resolved much like how you would in the unsigned case: the leading bit is dropped. 
    </p>

    <p>
        However, from a mathematical perspective, signed overflows are handled differently than unsigned overflows. Whenever a positive overflow 
        occurs, the final sum is the initial sum minus 2^n; whenever a 
        negative overflow occurs, the final sum is the initial sum plus 2^n, where, in both cases, n is the number of bits in the strings.
    </p>
