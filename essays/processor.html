	<h2>Processor Architecture</h2>
	
	<p>February 2021</p>	
	
	<p>	
		A processor does work simply in the form of accessing and 
		modifying the program registers, the condition codes, the 
		program counter, and memory. When we write a program, we are 
		essentially writing a sequence of these activities that the 
		processor has to follow. 
	</p>

	<h3>Instruction Set Architecture</h3>
		
	<p>
		The set of instructions of a processor constitutes its 
		instruction set architecture (ISA). In addition to specfiying 
		what each instruction does, the ISA also specifies how the 
		instructions are encoded in terms bits. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Each instruction has an opcode that indicates the instruction 
		class. Some instructions have a function code that specifies a 
		particular instruction type within a class. 
		Most ISAs support the following classes of instructions: data 
		moves, ALU operations (eg. add, multiply, bitwise AND etc), 
		jumps, and stack operations (push and pop). 
	</p>

	<p>
		Some instructions have bits that specify which registers 
		to use as the operands. Each register in the processor has a 
		unique identifier. The CPU maintains a mapping of the registers 
		to their identifiers in a register file. 
	</p>

	<h3>Hardware</h3>

	<p>
		Logic gates are the basic buiding blocks of a computer system. 
		They implement Boolean functions such as AND and OR. Through 
		combinations of these logic gates, we can construct highly 
		complex digital circuits that generate nontrivial behaviors, 
		such as adding two numbers together.
	</p>

	<p>
		Combinational circuits that are built solely out of logic gates 
		cannot store information. To build a computer, we need 
		stateful hardware capable of storing state information. Two 
		components that fall under this category are clocked registers 
		and memory devices.
	</p>

	<p>
		A clocked register works as follows: the output of the register 
		always remains held at the current register state, regardless of 
		what the input is. The register state changes to the input only 
		when the clock input rises, ie. goes from low to high. Memory 
		devices operate in a similar fashion.
