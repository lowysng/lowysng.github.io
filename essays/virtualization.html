	<h2>Virtualization</h2>
	
	<p>February 2021</p>

	<h3>Process: Virtualizing CPU, User Mode and Kernel Mode, Timer Interrupts, Scheduling, Context Switches </h3>

	<p>
		A machine does work by executing a series of instructions called a program. An executing 
		(or running) program is called a process. This process abstraction is provided and managed 
		by the operating system (OS).
	</p>

	<p>
		Very often we want to run m processes on n processors where m > n. This is achieved with 
		the help of the OS, using a technique called CPU virtualization. To understand CPU 
		virtualization, it helps to look at a process as a series of transitions of the machine 
		state. The machine state consists of a number of different components of the machine, but 
		the most critical ones are the registers and memory. These two components are constantly 
		accessed and modified by any process.
	</p>

	<p>
		From this perspective, the idea of a process becomes clear. A process is either running 
		or not running. When a process is running, it is constantly accessing and updating registers 
		and memory. In contrast, a process that is not running does not modify the machine state. 	
	</p>

	<p>
		One of the responsibilities of the OS is to manage and keep track of all running processes 
		in a system. The OS achieves this via a process list. All running processes can be found 
		in this list, along with information about each individual process such as the process state 
		and the register context for that process.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since the OS is itself a piece of software, an OS that is currently running on a machine 
		is itself a process! This raises one very tricky problem: when the processor is running 
		a user process (non-OS process), how can the OS ensure that the user process does only 
		the things it is supposed to do, and, when this is not the case, regain control of the 
		processor and the machine? 
	</p>

	<p>
		The solution to this is twofold. First, we introduce two modes that the processor can 
		run in: user mode and kernel mode. Code that runs in user mode is restricted in what 
		it can do. In constrast, code that runs in kernel mode is allowed to run without 
		restrictions. The OS always runs in kernel mode. Most processes in the process list run 
		in user mode. A user process that wants to perform a privileged operation must give up 
		control and let the OS perform the operation on its behalf.
	</p>

	<p>
		Second, we install a timer device into the machine. This device raises an interrupt 
		every time the timer runs out. When a timer interrupt is raised, the currently running 
		process is stopped, and a pre-configured interrupt handler in the OS runs, effectively 
		passing control back to the OS. The purpose of this timer device is to ensure that no 
		rogue process is able to take over the machine.
	</p>

	<p>
		When the interrupt handler is invoked and control is passed back to the OS, the OS 
		has to decide whether to continue running the current process or switch to a new one.
		The algorithm that decides this is called the scheduler. There are several popular 
		scheduling policies: First-In-First-Out, Shortest-Job-First, Shortest-Time-to-Completion-First,
		Round-Robin, Multi-Level Feedback Queue, lottery scheduling, stride scheduler, the 
		Linux Completely Fair Scheduler etc. See <a href="./scheduler.html">Scheduler</a> 
		for more details.
	</p>

	<p>
		When the OS decides to switch to a new process, it performs a context switch, saving 
		the register context for the currently-executing process, and restoring the register 
		context for the new process. The register context is the contents of the register 
		while the program is running. 
	</p>

	<h3>Memory: Virtualizing Memory, Virtual Address Space, Page Table, Page Swapping, Thrashing</h3>
	
	<p>
		In addition to virtualizing the processor, the OS also virtualizes another  
		component of the machine --- memory. Rather than accessing physical memory directly,
		processes access a virtualized form of physical memory called the address space. Each 
		process has its own address space that contains everything the process needs to run 
		properly: the instructions that make up the program, and the process's stack and heap. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The OS enforces isolation and protection between the processes by making sure that each 
		process has access only to its own address space. Whenever a process tries to access 
		memory outside its own address space, an exception is raised and the OS takes over. 
	</p>

	<p>
		One consequence of the address space abstraction is that there are now two kinds of 
		addresses: virtual addresses and physical addresses. Virtual addresses exist only 
		within the context of a process's address space. Whenever a process makes a reference 
		to memory, it always does so via a virtual address. It is up to the OS to translate 
		this virtual address into an actual physical address. Address translation is sped up 
		with the help of a hardware cache called the translation lookaside buffer (TLB).
	</p>

	<p>
		How should the OS organize physical memory in order to support the address space 
		abstraction? One solution is paging. The core idea behind paging is to divide physical 
		memory into equal-sized chunks called page frames. Similarly, the virtual address space 
		of a process is divided into same-sized chunks called virtual pages. Each virtual page 
		of the process's address space maps to a physical page frame.
	</p>

	<p>
		The mapping from the virtual pages of a process's address space to the page frames of 
		physical memory is stored in a per-process data structure called the page table. The 
		virtual page number is used to index the page table. The entries of this table are 
		called the page table entries (PTEs). Each PTE holds a number of useful information. 
		The most critical information is the corresponding physical page frame mapped to by 
		this particular virtual page.
	</p>

	<p>
		For efficiency reasons, page tables are typically arranged in multiple levels. A page 
		table is broken up into equal-sized page table chunks, and these page table chunks are 
		stored in a data structure called the page directory. To find the PTE of a particular 
		virtual page, search through the page directory to find the page table chunk that contains 
		the PTE. Then, look inside this page table chunk to find and extract the actual PTE.
	</p>

	<p>
		It is unreasonable to fit the address space of all currently running processes in physical memory 
		at once. To address this issue, the OS will have to reserve additional space lower down 
		in the memory hierarchy (typically the disk). This space is called the swap space because 
		pages are swapped into and out of this space. A present bit in the PTE indicates whether 
		a page is currently residing in physical memory or in disk.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		When a reference is made to a page that is not currently residing in physical memory, 
		the page fault handler of the OS is invoked. The requested page is identified and moved 
		into memory. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The OS will try to keep some parts of phsyical memory vacant. When the amount of free 
		space is lower than some threshold (low watermark), the OS runs a background thread 
		called the swap daemon that evicts pages continually until the amount of free space 
		becomes at least some value (high watermark). 
	</p>

	<p>
		The manner in which pages get evicted depends on the eviction policy. Examples of some 
		eviction policies: First-In-First-Out,random eviction, Least-Recently-Used etc. 
		In the general case, the best approach is to use LRU. Additionally, when evicting pages, 
		clean pages are preferred over dirty pages because dirty pages need to be rewritten into 
		disk before they can be evicted.
	</p>

	<p>
		Despite this, it is still possible for the memory demand of the machine to exceed those 
		supplied by physical memory. This results in a system that is constantly paging, a 
		condition known as thrashing. The OS needs to be able to detect when thrashing occurs, 
		and be able to cope with them. Two methods for addressing thrashing is to limit the 
		number of processes that are allowed to run or to run an out-of-memory killer daemon 
		that finds and terminates memory-intensive processes.
