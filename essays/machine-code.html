	<h2>Machine Code</h2>

	<p>February 2021</p>

	<p>
		When you write a program in a high level language such as C or Python, that program 
		has to be processed first before it becomes readily executable by a computer. One 
		of these processing stages is called compilation. Compilation is the process of transforming 
		a program written in a high level language into a lower level, bare metal form. This form 
		of low level code is also called assembly code.
	</p>

	<p>
		The goal of compilation is to produce assembly code that not only has the same behavior as 
		the parent high level program, but also code that runs quickly and efficiently. Sometimes, this 
		transformation can yield programs that are so heavily transformed and highly unreadable.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Hidden State</h3>

	<p>
		Assembly code reveals certain processor states that are normally hidden when programming in 
		high-level languages. One of these is the program counter, which specifies the address of the 
		currently executing instruction. Note that this implies that all the instructions of a program
		are stored somewhere in memory. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Another part of the processor state that is hidden from the programmer is the CPU register file. 
		The CPU register file stores information about the various CPU registers. These registers are 
		used to hold temporary data. Some registers hold critical information about the running program. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		For example, 
		the stack pointer register always points to the runtime stack of the currently executing program. 
		Another example is the set of condition code registers, which hold information about the result of the 
		most recently executed instruction, such as whether the computation yielded a zero. 
	</p>

	<h3>Moving Data</h3>

	<p>
		An assembly program is made up of a sequence of instructions. Let's now look at the set of most 
		commonly used instructions --- data movement instructions. These instructions, quite literally, 
		move data around the computer. The possible source and destination of a data movement instruction 
		are immediate values, register values and values stored in memory. For instance, an instruction 
		might instruct the processor to transfer a string of bits from memory into one of the registers.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is a special class of data movement instructions that interact with the runtime stack of a 
		program. These are the PUSH and POP instruction. A PUSH X instruction decrements the stack 
		pointer, and transfers X into memory at the location specified by the just decremented stack 
		pointer. X here can either be an immediate value or a register. 
		A POP Y instruction transfers the string of bits at the memory location specified by the 
		stack pointer into register Y, and then increments the stack pointer. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The most important use case of the PUSH and POP instructions is in implementing the procedure 
		calling mechanisms of high level languages. We will see how this is done in a later section.
	</p>

	<h3>Crunching Data</h3>

	<p>
		Data movement instructions move data. In contrast, ALU (shorthand for Arithmetic & Logical Unit) 
		instructions "crunches" data. These instructions perform various operations such as integer 
		addition, integer multiplication, bitwise AND, bitwise OR, bit shifts, integer increments, integer 
		decrements etc. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Different ALU instructions have different number of operands. However, all of them have one 
		property in common --- they modify the value of some register. For instance, an ADD X Y 
		instruction takes the value stored in register X, add this to the value stored at register Y,
		and storing this value in register Y (overwriting the previous value of Y).
	</p>
	
	<h3>Conditionals</h3>

	<p>
		Another quirk of these ALU instructions is that in addition to modifying some general purpose 
		register, they also modify the condition code registers of the CPU. These condition code registers 
		are used to implement conditional branches, which are pieces of code that execute conditionally 
		based on the outcome of some tests.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Recall that condition code registers are updated only at the end of an ALU instruction. Other 
		than the ALU instructions, there are two non-ALU instructions that also modify the condition code 
		registers, called COMPARE and TEST. These instructions behave similarly to SUB and AND, except 
		that they do not modify the contents of the target register.
	</p>

	<p>
		These condition codes are used by JUMP instructions. JUMP instructions cause execution to switch to a new 
		position in the program. There are two kinds of JUMP: conditional jump instructions jump to the target 
		instruction depending on some combination of the condition code registers; unconditional jump instructions 
		jump to the target instruction regardless of the contents of the condition code registers.
	</p>

	<p>
		High-level loop constructs can be implemented using conditional jump instructions. There are two paradigms 
		for implementing conditional branching. The first is based on conditional control --- 
		program execution jumps to different parts of the program based on the result of some test; the second is 
		based on conditional moves --- both outcomes of a branch are computed, and the desired one is selected.
		Conditional moves have better performance characteristics on modern processors because they do not involve 
		branch prediction (code is executed sequentially).
