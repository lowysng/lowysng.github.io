	<h2>OS and Processes</h2>
		
	<p>February 2021</p>

	<h3>Operating Systems</h3>

	<p>
		A machine does work by executing instructions. The operating system (OS) is a piece 
		of software that is in charge of making sure the machine executes instructions correctly 
		and efficiently. 
	</p>
	
	<p>	
		The OS achieves this by providing a host of things: some means of virtualizing 
		the CPU and memory, resource management, standard library (syscalls), file system, and 
		concurrency management.
	</p>

	<h3>Processes</h3>
		
	<p>
		One of the most fundamental abstractions provided by the OS is the process. 
		Before it is ready to do some work, a process has to first be created by the OS. This involves 
		loading the program's instructions from disk to memory and allocating some additional memory 
		for the program's stack and heap. 
	</p>

	<p>
		During its lifetime, a process may transition between several 
		states. For instance, the OS may schedule or deschedule a process, causing it to transition to the 
		running state or ready state, respectively. A process can also enter the blocked state, one 
		example is when it initiates an I/O operation. Once a process has finished executing the entire program, 
		the OS destroys the process and frees up all memory used by the process.
	</p>

	<p>
		The OS keeps track of all running processes in a process list, along with some additional accounting 
		information, such as which program is currently running, for instance. Furthermore, the OS also keeps track of
		information about each individual process. For example, the register context of a stopped process holds 
		the contents of the registers just before the process transitions into the stop state. 
	</p>

	<h3>Limited Direct Execution</h3>

	<p>
		The process abstraction itself does not solve the problem of running m programs on n 
		processors, where m > n. This section discusses how the OS is able to virtualize the 
		CPU efficiently while, at the same time, retaining control over the machine.
	</p>

	<p>
		To ensure that a process does only the things it is supposed to, we introduce two modes 
		that the processor can run in: user mode and kernel mode. Code that runs in user mode is 
		restricted in what it can do. For instance, a piece of code running in user mode cannot issue 
		I/O requests. In contrast, code that runs in kernel mode is free to do whatever it wants.
	</p>

	<p>
		The OS (or kernel) always runs in kernel mode. Most processes in the process list run in user mode.  
		A process that wants to perform some privileged operation 
		must give up control and let the OS perform the operation on its behalf. 
	</p>

	<p>
		To do this, the process performs a system call by executing a trap instruction. This raises the 
		privilege level and causes control to be passed over to the OS. When the OS has finished performing 
		the requested operation, it executes a return-from-trap instruction, which lowers the privilege level
		back and returns control to the calling program. 
	</p>

	<p>
		For security reasons, a program performs a system call by specifying an identifer called the 
		system-call number (as opposed to jumping to the address of the target instruction). The syscall 
		number is used to index a trap table, which specifies the location in memory of the trap handlers. The trap 
		table is set up by the kernel at boot time. 
	</p>

	<h3>Regaining Control</h3>

	<p>
		How can the OS regain control of the processor while the processor is running in user mode? 
		One approach is based on trust, that is, the OS assumes that any processes running in user mode will 
		issue a trap instruction eventually and pass control back to the OS. This approach is less than ideal. 
		For example, the only fix to a program that is stuck in an infinite loop is to reboot the system.
	</p>

	<p>
		A better approach is to use a timer interrupt. A timer interrupt is an interrupt that is raised in regular
		intervals. When the interrupt is raised, the current process halts, and control is passed back to 
		the operating system, which runs a boot time-configured interrupt handler.
	</p>

	<h3>Context Switches</h3>

	<p>
		Anytime the OS regains control of the machine, it has to make the decision of whether to continue running 
		the current process or switch to a new one. This decision is made by the scheduler, which we do not get into 
		in this essay. Instead, we discuss context switches.
	</p>

	<p>
		Simply put, the OS performs a context switch by saving the values of some registers for the currently-executing 
		process, and restore them for the new process. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that there is a subtle difference between the register saves/restores that occur during a trap 
		instruction and those that occur in a context switch routine. Suppose that a context switch occurs from 
		process A to process B. This context switch routine causes the system to move from running as if it just trapped 
		into the kernel from A to as if it just trapped into the kernel from B.
