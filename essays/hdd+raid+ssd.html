	<h3>Hard Disk Drives</h3>

	<p>
		Hard disk drives (HDDs) are the most common persistent storage devices today.
		They provide a very cost effective way of storing bits long term.
	</p>

	<p>
		Logically, a disk drive is an array of sectors (or blocks or chunks of bits). 
		Physically, a disk drive consists of a collection of circular platters. 
		The surfaces of these platters contain tracks, which are just concentric
		circles on the surfaces. These tracks are where information is actually stored on.
		Each surface has a disk head that reads and writes data onto the tracks. The
		disk heads are all connected to the disk arm, which moves them across the 
		platters. Finally, the platters spin at a constant RPM around a spindle that 
		is connected to a motor.
	</p>

	<p>
		Not surprisingly, the I/O time (the amount of time required to read or write 
		data) depends somewhat heavily on the physical quirks of the disk drives. For instance, to 
		access data that are in some logical sector, first the disk head needs to be 
		moved to the correct track by the disk arm (called seeking). Then the disk head 
		needs to wait for the platter to rotate to the desired location, before it can 
		start reading or writing data. Therefore, the total I/O time is the sum of the 
		seek time, the rotational delay, and the actual transfer time.
	</p>

	<p>
		A significant portion of the I/O time is spent on seeking and rotation. Seek time 
		and rotational delays take on the order of milliseconds to complete, whereas 
		transfer time takes on the order of microseconds. This implies a huge difference 
		in performance depending on whether the workload is sequential or random. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Sequential I/O is much faster than random I/O. In sequential I/O, disk 
		is accessed sequentially. This means that the disk head only needs to perform 
		the seek operation and wait once to transfer a large amount of data. In a 
		random workload, the disk head has to perform seek and wait multiple times, 
		each time only transferring a small amount of data.
	</p>

	<h3>Redundant Array of Inexpensive Disks (RAIDs)</h3>

	<p>
		The idea of RAID is to use multiple physical disks to construct a disk system that
		is faster, has more capacity, and is capable of tolerating disk failures. The OS 
		interacts with a RAID system much like it does a typical disk --- it issues 
		logical I/O to the RAID system, and the RAID system translates this into a 
		physical I/O. Physically, the RAID system can be quite complex --- it has its own 
		controller and memory.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are multiple ways of setting up a RAID system, each one with its own 
		pros and cons. In this discussion we assume that there are N disks in the RAID 
		system, and that each disk has capacity B, single I/O latency of T, sequential 
		throughput S, and random throughput R.
	</p>

	<p>
		The most simplest RAID system is RAID0 or striping. RAID0 maps each logical 
		sector to a physical disk horizontally. Horizontal here means that the consecutive 
		sectors are mapped to different disks, and this mapping wraps around when it 
		reaches the last disk in the system. RAID0 delivers full performance and capacity
		of all the disks but it provides zero redundancy. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Unlike RAID0, RAID1 or mirroring provides some level of redundancy by storing two copies of 
		each logical sector on different disks. The advantage of this setup is that the whole system 
		can now tolerate 1 disk failure, and up to N/2. The problem however is that it is highly wasteful in 
		terms of capacity --- half of the total capacity is used to store redundant information. 
		In terms of performance, single I/O latency stays roughly the same. Random read throughput
		in RAID1 has an upper bound of NR. Random writes and sequential throughputs are all halved 
		--- the reason being that the number of logical I/O that can be performed at one time is N/2.
	</p>

	<p>
		RAID4 is a parity-based setup that provides some redundancy without sacrificing that much 
		in terms of capacity, though it does suffer a bit in terms of performance. RAID4 assigns 
		one of the disks as the parity disk, which can be used to reconstruct a disk in case 
		of a disk failure. RAID4 setups have a capacity of (N-1)B, and can tolerate at most 1 
		disk failure. Single read performance is unchanged. Single write, however, now takes twice 
		the amount of time to perform because of the parity disk. Sequential throughput and 
		random read throughput are (N-1)S and (N-1)R respectively because of the same reason. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Random write is the most heavily affected, with a performance of R/2. This is because 
		the parity disk has become a bottleneck. Two logical writes cannot occur in parallel because 
		each one needs to read and write into the parity disk. RAID5 addresses this problem by 
		spreading the parity information across disks as opposed to storing them in just one disk.
	</p>

	<p>
		RAID5 has the same performance characteristics as RAID4, except for random throughput.
		Random reads now has an upper bound of NR, whereas random writes has an upper bound of 
		NR/4. The first factor of 2 is due to the fact that 2 disks are accessed in each logical
		random write, and the second factor of 2 is is due to the fact that 2 physical I/Os are 
		required to perform 1 logical I/O.
	</p>

	<h3>Solid-State Storage Drives</h3>

	<p>
		A solid-state storage device (SSD) is another device that can store information persistently.
		One class of SSDs are flash-based SSDs. These SSDs are built out of flash chips, 
		which are transistor based. Since there are no physical parts involved, flash-based
		SSDs have a higher transfer rate than traditional disk drives. They are also slightly 
		more expensive.
	</p>

	<p>
		SSDs organize flash chips into flash blocks and flash pages. A flash block contains 
		multiple flash pages, these flash pages are where information gets stored. SSDs 
		support three main operations: read a page, write a page, and erasing a block. 
		SSDs have a slightly different mode of operation: before writing to a page, the 
		block containing the page must first be erased. Also, flash pages can wear out when they 
		are written into too often.
	</p>

	<p>
		To make sure that the SSDs are properly utilized, the OS does not interact with the flash chips 
		of the SSDs directly. Rather, as is the case with RAID systems, the OS interacts with 
		an SSD indirectly via the flash translation layer (FTL). FTL converts logical requests 
		into physical requests, using its own control logic and volatile memory. The FTL ensures 
		two things: that the amount of write amplication is low, and that the write operations are 
		spread evenly among the flash chips so that they wear out at roughly the same rate. Most 
		FTLs achieve these goals using a log structured approach 
		(see <a href="./filesystems.html#log-structured">File Systems</a>).
