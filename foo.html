I don't know exactly what it's like out there, but personally, as a 23 year old person 
who has thought somewhat deeply about what he wants out of his own short life on this earth, 
I am not very optimistic about the state of the world as it is and the trajectory it is heading
towards. Every now and then, something nice happens that makes the world feel less dreaded 
and miserable. But I feel that's the exceptional case --- most of the time, things are just 
naturally bound to go to shit.
</p>
<p>
Maybe its social media. Every day, I open up my phone and my face gets instantly blasted by 
threads of someone on the Internet yelling at some other person on the Internet.
Or articles that provide zero value to anyone other than their clickbait titles that are 
designed to misinform and get your blood boiling as quick as possible. Or profiles of people 
that you probably will never interact with in your life, but nonetheless worship. 
</p>
<p>
Maybe its the corporations. This one bums me out really bad. I don't know how overworking 
yourself became the norm. I've never had a real job (currently have other plans going on), 
but I am not looking forward to getting one at all. Whatsapp groups that never shut themselves 
up? No, thank you. Phone calls from your boss asking you for something while you are out 
having dinner with your friends? No, thank you. "Being a hard worker is a virtue". Yes, 
that is correct. But most people never get fairly compensated for their work. Where is the 
line between hard work and exploitation? Is there even one?
</p>
<p>
Maybe its the schools. These facilities label themselves as "educational institutes", but 
if you look closer, you'd start to think, maybe the more appropriate term is "businesses".
Most people go to school not to learn how to think but to become sheeps. Graduates that 
know nothing beyond passing standardized exams. People that spout not what's on their minds 
but what other people are spouting. "100% graduate employability", "Top 10 in Asia", 
"Top 100 in the world". Look closer again and you'll see the little asterisks that follow 
the claims. 
</p>
<p>
Maybe its the pandemic. This one's not that bad. At least it is temporary and not permanent.
Still, I think the legacy of COVID should not be about the disease itself but about how it 
revealed the incompetencies of those that are at the top --- those that are supposed to get 
things in order and under control. Perhaps I am underestimating the difficulty of the task 
at hand, but others are dealing with it just fine. What's our excuse?
