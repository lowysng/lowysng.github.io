                <b>Live lectures</b>: Our lectures are not pre-recorded. We choose to 
                deliver them live because live lectures can be more engaging; we want 
                students to be able to ask questions, and get answers to these questions 
                instantly.
            </p>

                <b>First lesson free-of-charge</b>: We understand that a tuition 
                program that is fully online might not be for everyone, so, to 
                help you find out whether this works for you, we won't charge 
                you for your first lesson.
            </p>
