                We are able to keep our prices low because we don't have to deal with fees that 
                are typical of a traditional, brick-and-mortar based tuition centre. Another reason 
                is that we are a a freshly launched business, and our goal right now is to spread 
                the words and attract as many students as possible. Once we have established an initial 
                student base, then we will be making adjustments to our pricing structure.
