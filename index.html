    <h2>What is a Computer?</h2>
    <p>
        I like to answer this question in two parts: bits, and instructions.
    </p>
    <h3>Bits</h3>
    <p>
        Let's start with the bits. Suppose that you are on a cliff overlooking the ocean. 
        It is currently night time and you have two flashlights on you. Your job is to use 
        these flashlights to come up with a scheme to indicate to all incoming ships on whether 
        it is safe for them to dock.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>If it is safe to dock, shine both flashlights.</li>
        <li>Otherwise, keep flashlights turned off.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        To achieve this, you (and the ship captains) agree to follow these rules:
        This is a very simple scheme, and it works. Try to understand what is going on here.
        The actual turning on/off of the flashlights is physically unrelated to whether it is safe 
        or unsafe for the ships to dock. But since all parties have agreed beforehand on what the 
        meaning of each action is, these actions now carry a different meaning that is present only 
        in this specific context. In all other contexts, the turning on/off of the flashlights is 
        meaningless, or worse, it could carry a different meaning, which may lead to misunderstandings and 
        possibly harm.
    </p>
    <p>
        This process of using one thing to represent another thing is called symbolism.
        Symbolism is a very fundamental idea in computer science. We know that computers 
        read bits (ones and zeros). One of the reasons computers are so ubiquitous today is because of 
        the fact that these lowly bits are capable of representing not just anything, but a <i>very large</i> number 
        of anything.
    </p>
    <p>
        At the software level, we use 
        one piece of code (variables) to represent other pieces of code. At the hardware level, voltages 
        on electrical circuits are used to represent bits (ones and zeros), which are in turn used to 
        represent data and instructions. The pictures that you upload onto the Internet, the articles 
        that you read, the videos that you watch, all of these things exist as nothing but 
        mere ones and zeros.
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
        We just saw how bits can be used to represent information. Let's now take a very shallow look 
        at how a computer reads and executes computer instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
        Essentially, a computer does one thing, and one thing only -- execute instructions. A typical 
        sequence of computer instructions might consist of the following:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Read a string of bits in memory.</li>
        <li>Read a different string of bits in memory.</li>
        <li>Compute the sum of these two string of bits.</li>
        <li>Store the resulting string of bits in memory.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        These elementary operations (reading from memory, writing into memory, performing an operation) form 
        the basis of a large subset of the set of all instructions of a modern processor. The four 
        instructions above may be written, in computer instruction form, as the following:
    </p>
    <ol class="code">
        <li>MOVE 00101010 TO 00000000</li>
        <li>MOVE 10010010 TO 00000001</li>
        <li>ADD 00000000 TO 00000001</li>
        <li>MOVE 00000001 TO 10010010</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        The first instruction says to move the bits in memory location 00101010 into 
        memory location 00000000. The third instruction says to add the bits in memory 
        location 00000000 to the bits in memory location 00000001 (in place).
    </p>
    <p>
        But wait, computers can only read zeros and ones, how does it read the textual part 
        of the instructions, i.e. MOVE and ADD? The answer is, they don't. The instruction form 
        above is not the final form that gets read by the computer. The actual final form looks 
        something like the following:
    </p>
    <ol class="code">
        <li>00100010101000000000</li>
        <li>00101001001000000001</li>
        <li>10110000000000000001</li>
        <li>00100000000110010010</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you look closely, you might notice some common characteristics between these four instructions 
        and the four instructions before them. Instructions 1, 2 and 4 all start with the same 
        four bits: 0010. You might guess that these four bits 0010 represent the MOVE instruction, and 
        you would be right. The first four bits specify the type of operation to perform (MOVE or ADD), the next 
        sixteen bits specify the source and destination memory locations.
